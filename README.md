Inspired by https://revspace.nl/Decennium, a printed map of the Netherlands (https://tkkrlab.nl/wiki/Hackerspaces) showing the space states in near realtime.

Space states are collected through the update_states.py script, which polls the spaceapi links and subscribes to the MQTT server when configured in the space directory.
